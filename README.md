## DESCRIPTION
 Empowering Blood Donation Ecosystem: Our Blood Bank Management App revolutionizes the way blood donation centers operate, ensuring seamless coordination between donors, recipients, and healthcare institutions. With a user-friendly interface and robust features, the app facilitates every aspect of blood management, from donor registration to real-time inventory tracking and swift distribution. Donors can easily register, schedule appointments, and receive notifications, fostering a culture of regular donation. For blood banks, the app streamlines inventory management, automates donor screening, and provides analytics for informed decision-making. Healthcare providers gain instant access to available blood units, enabling timely responses to emergencies. With its intuitive design and advanced functionalities, our app ensures an efficient, transparent, and lifesaving blood donation ecosystem.

## IN THE DIRECTORY ,RUN :



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
